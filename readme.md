## Outside Code
Bootstrap is used for extra styling. It is linked to with the following URL: 
//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css

For the lorem ipsum text, I used the badcow/lorem-ipsum package, which can be found here:

For the random user information, I used the fzaninotto/faker package, which can be found here:
